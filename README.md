# Voice Identity Morph (VIM) Code
Code for generating Voice Identity Morph (VIM) using the DeepTalk encoder. The paper may be found here: &lt;coming soon>

See https://github.com/iPRoBe-lab/DeepTalk/ for instructions to set up the DeepTalk encoder. Alternatively, ECAPA-TDNN (https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/spkrec-ecapa-voxceleb) or other encoding methods may be used in a similar manner to generate voice morphs via the VIM method. See our paper for the outlined method.
